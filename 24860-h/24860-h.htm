<h4><a name = "intro" id = "intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h4>


<p>Since most publishers of <i>Pamela</i> have preferred to print
Richardson’s table of contents from the sixth edition, his complete
introduction (his preface, together with letters to the editor and
comments) is missing even from some of our best collections.
Occasionally one finds the preface and the first two letters, but only
four publishers since Richardson have attempted to reprint the full
introduction. Harrison (London, 1785) -- who omits the first letter --
and Cooke (London, 1802-3) both follow Richardson’s eighth edition;
Ballantyne (Edinburgh, 1824) uses the fourth; the Shakespeare Head
(Oxford, 1929), the third. And even these printings leave one
dissatisfied. The Shakespeare Head gives the fullest text, but naturally
omits Richardson’s revisions; Cooke gives the introduction in its final
form, but one misses the full text which accompanied the book in its
heyday; and rarely are both Cooke and Shakespeare Head to be found in
the same library.</p>

<p>Richardson’s complete introduction gains importance when we note that
he retained and revised it through seven of his eight editions of
<i>Pamela</i>. To see the text and follow Richardson’s changes is to get
an unusually intimate view of his attitude toward his book, of his
concessions and tenacities, of Richardson the anonymous “editor” who
could not keep the author’s laurels completely under his hat.</p>

<p>This present reprint, therefore, intends to give the fullest text of
Richardson’s introduction, and to indicate his changes. The text is that
of the second edition, reproduced with permission of the Huntington
Library. Brackets, added to this
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
<!-- png 04 -->
lithoprint, show Richardson’s principal corrections: “4th” means that
the bracketed lines were deleted in the fourth and all subsequent
editions; “4th, change&nbsp;6” means that in the fourth and subsequent
editions the bracketed lines were changed to the reading listed here as
number six. Several changes within deleted passages are discussed but
not marked on the text.</p>

<p>Richardson’s own editions of <i>Pamela</i> appeared as follows:
(1)&nbsp;November 6, 1740, (2)&nbsp;February 14, 1741, (3)&nbsp;March
12, 1741, (4)&nbsp;May 5, 1741, (5)&nbsp;September 22, 1741,
(6)&nbsp;May 10, 1742, (7)&nbsp;1754, (8)&nbsp;October 28, 1761<a class
= "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> (three months
after Richardson’s death). The first edition prints Richardson’s preface
and two complimentary letters. To these the “Introduction to this Second
Edition” adds twenty-four pages of letters and comment and the third
edition makes no changes in the introduction whatsoever, even retaining
“this Second Edition,”<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href =
"#note2">2</a> The fourth makes some changes, and the fifth,
considerably more. The sixth, a&nbsp;handsome quarto in a row of
duodecimos, abandons the introductory letters; the seventh follows the
fifth, and the eight makes some major cuts.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Richardson’s freedom in editing these letters -- and
Fielding’s insinuation in <i>Shamela</i> that they were Richardson’s own
copy -- he wrote none of them. Jean Baptiste de Freval, a&nbsp;Frenchman
living in London, for whom Richardson was
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<!-- png 05 -->
printing a book,<a class = "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href =
"#note3">3</a> wrote the first. The second probably came from William
Webster, clergyman and editor of <i>The Weekly Miscellany</i>, wherein
the letter had appeared as an advertisement, the first public reference
to <i>Pamela</i>, on October 11, 1740.<a class = "tag" name = "tag4" id
= "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a> Webster owed (an obligation eventually
forgiven) “a&nbsp;debt of 140 <i>l.</i> to my most worthy Friend, Mr.
<i>Richardson</i>, the <i>Printer</i>,”<a class = "tag" name = "tag5" id
= "tag5" href = "#note5">5</a> and Richardson reprints the letter using
Webster’s phrase: “To my worthy Friend, the Editor of <i>Pamela</i>.”
These first two letters, de Freval’s and Webster’s, respond to an
author’s request for criticism. The rest, new with the second edition,
are unsolicited.</p>

<p>All of these are the work of Aaron Hill, excepting only the anonymous
letter which Richardson summarizes, beginning on page xxi<a class =
"tag" name = "tag6" id = "tag6" href = "#note6">6</a> -- sent to
Richardson in care of Charles Rivington, co-publisher of <i>Pamela</i>,
on November 15, 1740, the first gratuitous response to Richardson’s
book. To advertisements in <i>The Daily Gazeteer</i> (November 20) and
<i>The London Evening-Post</i> (December 11-13), Richardson added a
note:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<!-- png 06 -->

<blockquote>
An anonymous Letter relating to this Piece is come to the Editor’s Hand,
who takes this Opportunity (having no better) most heartily to thank the
Gentleman for his candid and judicious Observations; and to beg Favour
of a further Correspondence with him, under what Restrictions he
pleases. Instruction, and not Curiosity, being sincerely the Motive for
this request.<a class = "tag" name = "tag7" id = "tag7" href =
"#note7">7</a>
</blockquote>

<p>If the gentleman had answered, the introduction to <i>Pamela</i>
would perhaps have been shorter. Some of Hill’s acerbity may have been
absorbed from Richardson, hurt by the writer’s silence.</p>

<p>The double-entendres mentioned on page xxii are given in the
gentleman’s unpublished letter in the Forster collection, in the
Victoria and Albert Museum:</p>

<blockquote>
Jokes are often more Severe, and do more Mischief, than more Solid
Objects -- to obviate some, why not omit P&nbsp;175 -- <i>betwixt Fear
and Delight</i> -- and P&nbsp;181 -- <i>I made shift to eat a bit of</i>
etc. <i>but I had no Appetite to any thing else</i>.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag8" id = "tag8" href = "#note8">8</a>
</blockquote>

<p>In the light of this letter, the second edition of <i>Pamela</i>
attests a curious fact: while Hill pontificates in the introduction
about ignoring such vulgarity of mind, Richardson has tiptoed back to
Volume Two and changed the questioned passages. From the second edition
forward, Pamela trembles during her wedding not “betwixt Fear and
Delight” but “betwixt Fear and Joy”; and although Richardson leaves
Pamela her shift on page 181, he changes her remark about appetite:
“I&nbsp;made shift to get down a
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<!-- png 07 -->
bit of Apple-pie, and a little Custard; but that was all.” By omitting
the specific objections from his summary, Richardson managed at one
stroke to save his righteousness in the introduction and his face in the
text.</p>

<p>Hill’s authorship of the introductory letters is easily established.
Anna Laetitia Barbauld includes Hill’s signature with a reduced version
of the one which here begins on page xvi (December 17, 1740).<a class =
"tag" name = "tag9" id = "tag9" href = "#note9">9</a> Thereafter,
Richardson’s italicized remarks, two of them added in later editions,
provide the links: “<i>Abstract of a second Letter from the same
Gentleman</i>,” etc.</p>

<p>With wonderful indirection, Richardson had sent a copy of
<i>Pamela</i> to Hill’s daughters, along with some other books, and, as
Hill writes Mallet, “without the smallest <i>hint</i>, that it was
<i>his</i>, and with a grave apology, as for a <i>trifle</i>, of too
light a species.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag10" id = "tag10" href =
"#note10">10</a> Hill thanked Richardson in the letter of December 17,
1740. Hill asks who on earth the author might be, hinting, the while, by
returning Richardson’s own phrase, that he understands that it is
Richardson himself: “this <i>Trifle</i> (for such, I&nbsp;dare answer
for the <i>Author</i>, His Modesty misguides him to think it).” Though
Hill tells Mallet that Richardson was “very loth ... a&nbsp;long time,
to confess it,” Richardson did not dally long. By December 29, 1740, he
has confirmed Hill’s guess. On that date Hill writes:</p>

<blockquote>
Acquainted with the amiable goodness of your heart, I&nbsp;can foresee
the pleasure it will give you, to have given
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
<!-- png 08 -->
another pleasure: and you heap it on me in the noblest manner, by the
joy you make me feel, at finding <i>Pamela’s</i> incomparable author is
the person I not only hop’d to hear was so, but whom I should have been
quite griev’d, disturb’d, and mortified, not to have really
found&nbsp;so.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Yet, I&nbsp;confess, till I began to read, I had not the least notion of
it. But I presently took notice, that whatever <i>Pamela</i> thought,
said, or did, was all transfusion of your own fine spirit. And as I know
not if there lives another writer, who could furnish her with such a
sapid sweetness as she fills the table with, I&nbsp;could not therefor
chuse but name <i>you</i> to my hope, as moulder of this maiden model.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag11" id = "tag11" href = "#note11">11</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Barbauld omits this letter but prints another from Hill to
Richardson, not to be found now in the Forster collection, bearing the
same date -- December 29, 1740 (I,&nbsp;56ff.). This letter furnishes
the “<i>delightful Story, so admirably related</i>” beginning on page
xxxi. From the second paragraph on (“We have a lively little Boy in the
Family”), the <i>Pamela</i> text is substantially the same as
Barbauld’s. But the first paragraph Richardson has contrived to suit his
editorial fiction.</p>

<p>The delightful story so gratified Mr. Richardson that he sent lively
little Harry Campbell (“the dear amiable boy”) two books, an event
almost enough to finish him:</p>

<blockquote>
Out burst a hundred <i>O Lords!</i> in a torrent of voice rendered
hoarse and half choaked by his passions. He clasped his trembling
fingers together; and his hands were strained hard, and held writhing.
His elbows were extended to the height of his shoulders, and his eyes,
all inflamed with delight, turned incessantly round from one side, and
one friend, to the other, scattering his triumphant ideas among us. His
fairy-face (ears and all) was flushed as red as his lips; and his flying
feet told his joy to the floor, in a wild and stamping impatience of
gratitude.<a class = "tag" name = "tag12" id = "tag12" href =
"#note12">12</a>
</blockquote>

<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<!-- png 09 -->
<p>The only other part of the introduction to <i>Pamela</i> elsewhere in
print is the concluding poem. This, too, is Hill’s, printed in <i>The
Weekly Miscellany</i>, February 28, 1741, along with his December 17
letter, and collected with Hill’s <i>Works</i> (III, 348-350). This is
the poem, it would seem, of which Hill boasts that he has given “Pamela”
a&nbsp;short “e” as Richardson intended, asserting that “Mr. Pope has
taught half the women in England to pronounce it wrong.”<a class = "tag"
name = "tag13" id = "tag13" href = "#note13">13</a> Pope in his
<i>Epistle to Miss Blount</i> (line 49), had made the “e” long:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>The gods, to curse Pamela with her prayers,</p>
<p>Gave the gilt coach and dappled Flanders mares,</p>
<p>The shining robes, rich jewels, beds of state,</p>
<p>And, to complete her bliss, a fool for mate.</p>
</div>

<p>Hill’s lines are somewhat less successful. He dedicated them to “the
Unknown Author of <u><i>Pamela</i></u>” two months after Richardson had
confessed his authorship.</p>

<p>Richardson changes one line in the poem. In Hill’s <i>Works</i> it
reads: “Whence <i>public wealth</i> derives its vital course.”
Richardson, a&nbsp;more modern man perhaps, reads “<i>public
Health</i>.” His emendation, however, improves Hill’s metaphor
concerning a blaze which is a pilot pointing out the source of public
wealth, which is drunk to prevent gangrene from blackening to the bone.
Further reflection led Richardson a year later to change “vital” to
“moral.”</p>

<p>Throughout the letters in his introduction, Richardson made changes,
all largely stylistic. That Richardson removed the letters from the
front of his book in response to criticism -- as Cross<a class = "tag"
name = "tag14" id = "tag14" href = "#note14">14</a>
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<!-- png 10 -->
and others have asserted -- is not quite accurate. He removed them from
the sixth edition, but put them back in the seventh and eighth; and his
alterations show him giving in to criticism only by inches, if indeed
his changes to his introduction are not more simply those of any author
trimming (and with Richardson, ever so little) his early
extravagances.</p>

<p>Richardson’s stubbornness here suggests other reasons for his
substituting a table of contents for his introduction in the sixth
edition. To print both would have been too prolix, even for Richardson;
and it seems that the table of contents, detailing the entire action,
together with the change to big quarto volumes, are Richardson’s efforts
to authenticate <i>Pamela</i> in the face of Chandler’s and Kelly’s
unauthorized sequel, <i>Pamela’s Conduct in High Life</i>, printed to
complete the two duodecimo volumes of Richardson’s original story.
Richardson’s sixth edition is the first in which his own additional two
volumes, written to forestall Chandler and Kelly, are included with the
first two as a complete four-volume unit. Twelve years later, in 1754,
his true <i>Pamela</i> established, he reverted to his introductory
letters. Hill’s death in 1750 may also have moved Richardson to restore
the introduction which was chiefly Hill’s work, recalling both his
friend and <i>Pamela’s</i> greener days. In the eighth edition, at the
end of his life, Richardson still kept the introductory letters, though
with some final constrictions.</p>

<p>Richardson makes the first changes to his introduction in the fourth
edition. Excepting minor clarifications, all deal with Hill’s answer to
the anonymous gentleman. The attitude toward this gentleman has
softened. The “rashest of All his Advices”
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<!-- png 11 -->
becomes merely the “least weigh’d” of his judgments, and his blindness
becomes oversight. He is no longer pedantic; he no longer makes vulgar
allusions, but only fears that they might be made.</p>

<p>In the fifth edition, Richardson seems chiefly concerned with
redundancy, but he also diminishes some of the praise. In deference to
the gentleman, it would seem, Richardson deletes his flattery of Hill on
pages xxix and xxxi, and “<i>some of the most beautiful Letters that
have been written in any Language</i>” become simply “<i>Letters</i>.”
Perhaps Richardson’s conscience was bothering him. Perhaps he had heard
from his anonymous correspondent after all: he now identifies the
gentleman’s remarks as coming “<i>in a Letter from the Country</i>.”
Unless pure fancy, this is new information, for the letter, now in the
Forster collection, in no way indicates its place of origin.
Richardson’s seeking of the gentleman through advertisement in London
newspapers suggests that he thought of his correspondent as a city
man.</p>

<p>In the fifth edition one detects a certain discomfort with the false
editorship and the praise Richardson permits himself with it. His direct
response to criticism is slight. He deletes “<i>from</i> low <i>to</i>
high <i>Life</i>,” since <i>Pamela’s Conduct in High Life</i> had
appeared four months previous. From the passages which Fielding
ridicules in <i>Shamela</i>, he drops no more than “wonderful” from
before “AUTHOR of <u><i>Pamela</i></u>.” In the passage introducing the
new letters (page&nbsp;xv) Richardson now apologizes. The Author, he
implies, wanted the praises omitted, but much to his sorrow the Editor
could not disentangle them from the “critical remarks.” The author’s
modesty, however, remains in the realm of possibility only.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<!-- png 12 -->
<p>Where self-praise is strong a vague uneasiness sets Richardson to
work on the style, unable to locate the center of his trouble. On
page&nbsp;v “<i>strongly interest them in the edifying Story</i>”
becomes “<i>attach their regard to the Story,</i>” but this is barely to
nibble at his phrase “<i>so probable, so natural, so lively</i>” just
preceding, which perished in the eighth edition.</p>

<p>Similarly, he attempts to cure the last paragraph of his preface
through minor incisions. He drops the parenthesis about the “<i>great
Variety of entertaining Incidents</i>”, and he diminishes “<i>these
engaging Scenes</i>” to “<i>it</i>”. But the paragraph is still too much
for him. In the eighth edition he cuts all but the outlines of his
editor-author pretext.</p>

<p>The seventh edition does no more than sharpen punctuation. The eighth
in general continues to trim little excesses, though the loss is
scarcely noticeable. Richardson further reduces Hill’s praise of the
book and his own praise of Hill, feeling his way toward a detached view
of his book, looking to posterity. Since <i>Pamela</i> has fulfilled the
prediction of foreign renown made by his French friend, de Freval,
Richardson now omits de Freval’s obliging treachery to the literature of
France (page ix). Since the “delightful story” is anecdotal and not
critical, it too disappears. Other changes simply testify an author’s
attention to his style, uninhibited by the fact that the style is indeed
not his. He deletes a senseless remark about masculine flexibility. He
removes “Nature” from the foundation of the narrative (title page and
page v, though left on page viii) probably to avoid implying that Nature
is in the foundation only.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<!-- png 13 -->
<p>From the first, Richardson’s disguise as editor is little more than
half-hearted. Its purpose was at first partly commercial, permitting
advertising in the preface. Four ladies urged him on, so, Richardson
confesses, he “struck a bold stroke in the preface... having the umbrage
of the editor’s character to screen [him] self behind.”<a class = "tag"
name = "tag15" id = "tag15" href = "#note15">15</a> But the author
nevertheless threw rather distinct shadows on the screen. His preface
speaks of the book altogether as a work of fiction: the editor has “set
forth” social duties; he has “painted” vice and virtue, “drawn”
characters, “raised,” “taught,” “effected,” and “embellished with a
great variety of entertaining incidents.” Yet, suddenly, the editor also
seems to have done nothing more than to have “perused these engaging
scenes,” written a preface, and gotten them into print.</p>

<p>Richardson cannot quite give the imaginary author substance. “These
sheets” have accomplished all the wonders claimed for them, not “the
author of these sheets.” Richardson speaks not of <i>the</i> author, but
of <i>an</i> author, of authors in general. The implication hangs over
the preface, and is strengthened by de Freval’s letter, that the editor
himself has worked up the story from the barest details of real life
(which is, of course, what Richardson did). De Freval continues to speak
of the work entirely as of creative writing. The epistolary style is
aptly devised; the book will become a pattern for this kind of fiction;
it is contrived for readers of all tastes. But, quite in contradiction,
de Freval also implies that the editor has shown him the author’s
original work, together with certain editorial changes necessary to
protect the real Pamela and Mr.&nbsp;B.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<!-- png 14 -->
<p>The second letter, presumably Webster’s, toys with the suggestion
that a young woman actually wrote the letters which Richardson edits:
“let us have <i>Pamela</i> as <i>Pamela</i> wrote it.” But this is only
in play. Although the writer disparages “<i>Novels</i>,” the note which
heads his letter when it first appeared in <i>The Weekly Miscellany</i>
speaks of the “Author of Pamela” who has “written an <i>English
Novel</i>,”<a class = "tag" name = "tag16" id = "tag16" href =
"#note16">16</a> and his opening remarks are clearly those of a critic
speaking of fiction.</p>

<p>Hill’s first letter goes solidly for the conclusion that an author,
a&nbsp;man of genius, wrote the book. The heading, “To the Editor of
<i>Pamela</i>”, is Richardson’s only attempt to bring Hill’s letter into
his already wavering line. In the fifth edition, however, he introduces
this letter with his only straight statement that an author, distinct
from the editor, is involved, an author who begged the editor not to
include flattery.</p>

<p>To the end of his days Richardson continued to sit under the
editorial shade -- <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i> was “published” by the
“editor of <i>Pamela</i> and <i>Clarissa</i>” -- enjoying the sunshine
of his authorship. His introduction to <i>Pamela</i> and the care he
took with it suggest more succinctly than anything else Richardson’s
flirtation with his adorers, which is not at all unlike that of his so
modest heroine.</p>

<h4><i>To the Editor of the Piece intitled, <span class =
"smallcaps">Pamela</span>; or, <em><span class =
"smallcaps">Virtue</span> Rewarded</em>.</i></h4>


<p><i>Dear <span class = "extended">SI</span>R,</i></p>

<p><span class = "dropcap">I</span> <span class =
"firstword">have</span> had inexpressible Pleasure in the Perusal of
your <span class = "smallcaps">Pamela</span>. It intirely answers the
Character you give of it in your Preface; nor have you said one Word too
much in Commendation of a Piece that has Advantages and Excellencies
peculiar to itself. For, besides the beautiful Simplicity of the Style,
and a happy Propriety and Clearness of Expression (the Letters being
written under the immediate Impression of every Circumstance which
occasioned them, and that to those who had a Right to know the fair
Writer’s most secret Thoughts) the several Passions of the Mind must, of
course, be more affectingly described, and Nature may be traced in her
undisguised Inclinations with much more Propriety and Exactness, than
can possibly be found in a Detail of Actions long past, which are never
recollected with the same Affections, Hopes, and Dreads, with which they
were felt when they occurred.</p>

<p>This little Book will infallibly be looked upon as the hitherto
much-wanted Standard or Pattern for this Kind of Writing. For it abounds
with lively Images and Pictures; with Incidents natural, surprising, and
perfectly adapted to the Story; with Circumstances interesting to
Persons in common
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "pageviii" id =
"pageviii">viii</a></span>
<!-- png 24 -->
Life, as well as to those in exalted Stations. The greatest Regard is
every where paid in it to Decency, and to every Duty of Life: There is a
constant Fitness of the Style to the Persons and Characters described;
Pleasure and Instruction here always go hand in hand: Vice and Virtue
are set in constant Opposition, and Religion every-where inculcated in
its native Beauty and chearful Amiableness; not dressed up in stiff,
melancholy, or gloomy Forms, on one hand, nor yet, on the other, debased
below its due Dignity and noble Requisites, in Compliment to a too
fashionable but depraved Taste. And this I will boldly say, that if its
numerous Beauties are added to its excellent Tendency, it will be found
worthy a Place, not only in all Families (especially such as have in
them young Persons of either Sex) but in the Collections of the most
curious and polite Readers. For, as it borrows none of its Excellencies
from the romantic Flights of unnatural Fancy, its being founded in Truth
and Nature, and built upon Experience, will be a lasting Recommendation
to the Discerning and Judicious; while the agreeable Variety of
Occurrences and Characters, in which it abounds, will not fail to engage
the Attention of the gay and more sprightly Readers.</p>

<p>The moral Reflections and Uses to be drawn from the several Parts of
this admirable History, are so happily deduced from a Croud of different
Events and Characters, in the Conclusion of the Work, that I shall say
the less on that Head. But I think, the Hints you have given me, should
also prefatorily be given to the Publick; <i>viz.</i> That it will
appear from several Things mentioned in the Letters, that the Story must
have happened within these Thirty Years past: That you have been obliged
to vary some of the Names of Persons, Places, <i>&amp;c.</i> and to
disguise a few of the Circumstances, in order to avoid giving Offence

<!-- png 25 -->
to some Persons, who would not chuse to be pointed out too plainly in
it; tho’ they would be glad it may do the Good so laudably intended by
the Publication. And as you have in Confidence submitted to my Opinion
some of those Variations, I&nbsp;am much pleased that you have so
managed the Matter, as to make no Alteration in the Facts; and, at the
same time, have avoided the digressive Prolixity too frequently used on
such Occasions.</p>

written with that Spirit of Truth and agreeable Simplicity, which, tho’
much wanted, is seldom found in those Pieces which are calculated for
the Entertainment and Instruction of the Publick. It carries Conviction
in every Part of it; and the Incidents are so natural and interesting,
that I have gone hand-in-hand, and sympathiz’d with the pretty Heroine
in all her Sufferings, and been extremely anxious for her Safety, under
the Apprehensions of the bad Consequences which I expected, every Page,
would ensue from the laudable Resistance she made. I&nbsp;have
interested myself in all her Schemes of Escape; been alternately pleas’d
and angry with her in her Restraint; <i>pleas’d</i> with the little
Machinations and Contrivances she set on foot for her Release, and
<i>angry</i> for suffering her Fears to defeat them; always lamenting,
with a most sensible Concern, the Miscarriages of her Hopes and
Projects. In short, the whole is so affecting, that there is no reading
it without uncommon Concern and Emotion. Thus far only as to the
<i>Entertainment</i> it gives.</p>

thro’ the whole Course of her Sufferings, she does not so much as
hesitate once, whether she shall sacrifice it to Liberty and Ambition,
or not; but, as if there were no other way to free and save herself,
carries on a determin’d Purpose to persevere in her Innocence, and wade
with it throughout all Difficulties and Temptations, or perish under
them. <span class = "delete" title = "{DEL. 8th}">It is an astonishing
Matter, and well worth our most serious Consideration, that a young
beautiful Girl, in the low Scene of Life and Circumstance in which
Fortune placed her, without the Advantage of a Friend capable to relieve
and protect her, or any other Education than what occurr’d to her from
her own Observation and little Reading, in the Course of her Attendance
on her excellent Mistress and Benefactress, could, after having a Taste
of Ease and Plenty in a higher Sphere of Life than what she was born and
first brought up in, resolve to return to her primitive Poverty, rather
than give up her Innocence.</span> I&nbsp;say, it is surprising, that a
young Person, so circumstanced, could, in Contempt of proffer’d Grandeur
on the one side, and in Defiance of Penury on the other, so happily and
prudently conduct herself thro’ such a Series of Perplexities and
Troubles, and withstand the alluring Baits, and almost irresistible
Offers of a fine Gentleman, so universally admired and esteemed, for the
Agreeableness of his Person and good Qualities, among all his
Acquaintance; defeat all his Measures with so much Address, and oblige
him, at last, to give over his vain Pursuit, and sacrifice his Pride and
Ambition to Virtue, and become the Protector of that Innocence which he
so long and so indefatigably labour’d to supplant: And all this without
ever having entertain’d the least previous
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "pagexii" id =

Design or Thought for that Purpose: No Art used to inflame him, no
Coquetry practised to tempt or intice him, and no Prudery or Affectation
to tamper with his Passions; but, on the contrary, artless and
unpractised in the Wiles of the World, all her Endeavours, and even all
her Wishes, tended only to render herself as un-amiable as she could in
his Eyes: Tho’ at the same time she is so far from having any Aversion
to his Person, that she seems rather prepossess’d in his Favour, and
admires his Excellencies, whilst she condemns his Passion for her.
A&nbsp;glorious Instance of Self-denial! Thus her very Repulses became
Attractions: The more she resisted, the more she charm’d; and the very
Means she used to guard her Virtue, the more endanger’d it, by inflaming
his Passions: Till, at last, by Perseverance, and a brave and resolute
Defence, the Besieged not only obtain’d a glorious Victory over the
Besieger, but took him Prisoner too.</p>

<p>I am charmed with the beautiful Reflections she makes in the Course
of her Distresses; her Soliloquies and little Reasonings with herself,
are exceeding pretty and entertaining: She pours out all her Soul in
them before her Parents without Disguise; so that one may judge of, nay,
almost see, the inmost Recesses of her Mind. A&nbsp;pure clear Fountain
of Truth and Innocence; a&nbsp;Magazine of Virtue and unblemish’d
Thoughts!</p>

<p>I can’t conceive why you should hesitate a Moment as to the
Publication of this very natural and uncommon Piece. I&nbsp;could wish
to see it out in its own native Simplicity, which will affect and please
the Reader beyond all the Strokes of Oratory in the World; for those
will but spoil it: and, should you permit such a murdering Hand to be
laid upon it, to gloss and tinge it over with superfluous and needless
Decorations, which, like too
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "pagexiii" id =

much Drapery in Sculpture and Statuary, will but encumber it; it may
disguise the Facts, mar the Reflections, and unnaturalize the Incidents,
so as to be lost in a Multiplicity of fine idle Words and Phrases, and
reduce our Sterling Substance into an empty Shadow, or rather
<i>frenchify</i> our <i>English</i> Solidity into Froth and
Whip-syllabub. No; let us have <i>Pamela</i> as <i>Pamela</i> wrote it;
in her own Words, without Amputation, or Addition. Produce her to us in
her neat Country Apparel, such as she appear’d in, on her intended
Departure to her Parents; for such best becomes her Innocence, and
beautiful Simplicity. Such a Dress will best edify and entertain. The
flowing Robes of Oratory may indeed amuse and amaze, but will never
strike the Mind with solid Attention.</p>

<p>In short, Sir, a Piece of this Kind is much wanted in the World,
which is but too much, as well as too early, debauched by pernicious
<i>Novels</i>. I&nbsp;know nothing Entertaining of that Kind that one
might venture to recommend to the Perusal (much less the Imitation) of
the Youth of either Sex: All that I have hitherto read, tends only to
corrupt their Principles, mislead their Judgments, and initiate them
into Gallantry, and loose Pleasures.</p>

<p>Publish then, this good, this edifying and instructive little Piece
for their sakes. The Honour of <i>Pamela</i>’s Sex demands <i>Pamela</i>
at your Hands, to shew the World an Heroine, almost beyond Example, in
an unusual Scene of Life, whom no Temptations, or Sufferings, could
subdue. It is a fine, and glorious Original, for the Fair to copy out
and imitate. Our own Sex, too, require it of you, to free us, in some
measure, from the Imputation of being incapable of the Impressions of
Virtue and Honour; <span class = "delete" title = "{DEL. 8th}">and to
shew the Ladies, that we are not inflexible while they are
so.</span></p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "pagexiv" id =

<!-- png 30 -->
<p>In short, the Cause of Virtue calls for the Publication of such a
Piece as this. Oblige then, Sir, the concurrent Voices of both Sexes,
and give us <i>Pamela</i> for the Benefit of Mankind: <span class =
"delete" title = "{DEL. 8th}">And as I believe its Excellencies cannot
be long unknown to the World, and that there will not be a Family
without it; so I make no Doubt but every Family that has it, will be
much improv’d and better’d by it.</span> ’Twill form the tender Minds of
<i>Youth</i> for the Reception and Practice of Virtue and Honour;
confirm and establish those of <i>maturer Years</i> on good and steady
Principles; reclaim the Vicious, and mend the Age in general; insomuch
that as I doubt not <i>Pamela</i> will become the bright Example and
Imitation of all the fashionable young Ladies of <i>Great Britain</i>;
so the truly generous Benefactor and Rewarder of her exemplary Virtue,
will be no less admired and imitated among the <i>Beau Monde</i> of our
own Sex. I&nbsp;am</p>

Story, when he stands in need of some blameable Characters. Tho’ his
Judgment compels him to mark ’em with disagreeable Colourings, so that
they make an odious Appearance at first, He can’t forbear, by an
unexpected and gradual Decline from Themselves, to soften and transmute

<blockquote>
<span class = "firstword">---No</span> Sentiments which I have here, or
in my last, express’d, of the sweet <i>Pamela</i>, being more than the
bare Truth, which every Man must feel, who lends his Ear to the
inchanting Prattler, why does the Author’s Modesty mislead his Judgment,
to suspect the Style wants Polishing?---No, Sir, there is an

<i>Simplicity</i>, and measured Fullness, in it, that, resembling Life,
outglows it! He has reconciled the <i>Pleasing</i> to the <i>Proper</i>.

<i>adorn’d</i> her, with such unpresum’d <i>Increase</i> of Loveliness;
sat with such neat Propriety of Elegant Neglect about her, that it threw
out All her Charms, with tenfold, and resistless Influence.---And so,

</blockquote>

<p><i><span class = "change ch3" title = "{5th}">There were formed by an
anonymous Gentleman, the following Objections to some Passages in the
Work.</span></i></p>

<p>1. That the Style ought to be a little raised, at least so soon as
<i>Pamela</i> knows the Gentleman’s Love is honourable, and when <span
class = "change ch3a" title = "{7th}">his</span> Diffidence is changed
to Ease: And from about the fourth Day after Marriage, it should be
equal to the Rank she is rais’d to, <span class = "delete" title =
"{DEL. 4th}">and charged to fill becomingly</span>.</p>

<p>2. That to avoid the Idea apt to be join’d with the Word
’<i>Squire</i>, the Gentleman should be styled Sir <i>James</i>; or Sir
<i>John</i>, &amp;c. and Lady <i>Davers</i> in a new Edition might
procure for him the Title of a Baronet.</p>

<p>3. That if the sacred Name were seldomer repeated, it would be
better; for that the Wise Man’s Advice is, <i>Be not righteous
over-much</i>.</p>

<p>4. That the Penance which <i>Pamela</i> suffers from Lady
<i>Davers</i> might be shorten’d: That she is too timorous after owning
her Marriage to that Lady, and ought to have a little more Spirit, and
<span class = "delete" title = "{DEL. 5th}">get away sooner out at the
Window, or</span> call her own Servants to protect, and carry her to her
Husband’s Appointment.</p>

<p>5. That Females are too apt to be struck with Images of Beauty; and
that the Passage where the Gentleman is said to span the Waist of
<i>Pamela</i> with his Hand, is enough to ruin a Nation of Women by
Tight-lacing.</p>

<p>6. That the Word <i>naughty</i> had better be changed to some other,
as <i>Bad</i>, <i>Faulty</i>, <i>Wicked</i>, <i>Vile</i>,
<i>Abominable</i>, <i>Scandalous</i>: Which in most Places would
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "pagexxii" id =
"pagexxii">xxii</a></span>
<!-- png 38 -->
give an Emphasis, for which recourse must otherwise be had to the
innocent Simplicity of the Writer; an Idea not necessary to the Moral of
the Story, nor of Advantage to the Character of the Heroine.</p>

<p>7. That the Words, <i>p.</i> 305. <i>Foolish Thing that I am</i>, had
better be <i>Foolish that I am</i>. The same Gentleman observes by way
of <i>Postscript</i>, that Jokes are often more severe, and do more
Mischief, than more solid Objections; and would have one or two Passages
alter’d, to avoid giving Occasion for the Supposition of a double
Entendre, particularly in two Places which he mentions, <i>viz.</i>
<i>p.</i>&nbsp;175. <i>and</i> 181.</p>

<p class = "space ital">
He is pleased to take notice of several other Things of less Moment,
some of which are merely typographical; and very kindly expresses, on
the Whole, a&nbsp;high Opinion of the Performance, and thinks it may do
a great deal of Good: For all which, as well as for his Objections, the
Editor gives him very sincere Thanks.</p>

<p class = "ital">
Others are of Opinion, That the Scenes in many Places, in the Beginning
especially, are too low; and that the Passions of Lady <em>Davers</em>,
in particular, are carried too high, and above Nature.</p>

<p class = "ital">
And others have intimated, That <em>Pamela</em> ought, for Example sake,
to have discharg’d Mrs. <em>Jewkes</em> from her Service.</p>

<p class = "ital">
These are the most material Objections that have come to hand, all which
are considered in the following <span class = "delete" title = "{DEL. 5th}">Extracts

The Gentleman’s Advice, not to alter <i>Pamela</i> at all, was both
friendly, and solidly just. I&nbsp;run in, with full Sail, to his
Anchorage, that the low Scenes are no more out of Nature, than the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "pagexxiii" id =

<span class = "folionum">a5</span>

high Passions of proud Lady <i>Davers</i>. Out of Nature, do they say?
’Tis my Astonishment how Men of Letters can read with such absent
Attention! They are so far from <i>Out</i> of <i>Nature</i>, They are
absolute <i>Nature herself</i>! or, if they must be confess’d her
<i>Resemblance</i>; they are <i>such</i> a Resemblance, at least, as our
<i>true Face</i> gives our <i>Face</i> in the <i>Looking-glass</i>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I wonder indeed, what it is, that the Gentlemen, who talk of <i>Low</i>
Scenes, wou’d desire should be understood by the Epithet?---Nothing,
properly speaking, is <i>low</i>, that suits well with the Place it is
rais’d to.----The Passions of Nature are the same, in the <i>Lord</i>,
and his <i>Coach-man</i>. All, that makes them seem different consists
in the <i>Degrees</i>, in the <i>Means</i>, and the <i>Air</i>, whereto
or wherewith they indulge ’em. If, in painting Distinctions like these,
(which arise but from the Forms of Men’s Manners, drawn from
<i>Birth</i>, <i>Education</i>, and <i>Custom</i>) a&nbsp;Writer
<i>falls short</i> of his Characters, there his Scene is a low one,
indeed, whatever high Fortune it flatter’d. But, to imagine that Persons
of Rank are above a Concern for what is thought, felt, or acted, by
others, of their Species, between whom and themselves is <i>no
Difference</i>, except such as was owing to Accident, is to reduce Human
Nature to a Lowness,--<i>too low</i> for the <i>Truth</i> of her
<i>Frailty</i>.--
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
In <i>Pamela</i>, in particular, we owe All to her <i>Lowness</i>. It is
to the docile Effects of this Lowness of <i>that amiable Girl</i>, in
her Birth, her Condition, her Hopes, and her Vanities, in every thing,
in short, but her <i>Virtue</i>,---that her Readers are indebted, for
the moral <i>Reward</i>, of that <i>Virtue</i>. And if we are to look
for the <i>Low</i> among the Rest of the Servants, less lovely tho’

they are, than a <i>Pamela</i>, there is something however, so glowingly
painted, in the Lines whereby the Author has mark’d their
Distinctions----Something, so movingly forceful, in the <i>Grief</i> at
their <i>Parting</i>, and <i>Joy</i> at the happy Return,---Something so
finely, at once, and so strongly and feelingly, <i>varied</i>, even in
the smallest and least promising, little Family Incidents! that I need
only appeal from the <i>Heads</i>, to the <i>Hearts</i> of the Objectors
themselves, whether these are <i>low</i> Scenes to be censur’d?
</blockquote>

<i>Tears</i>: which running down from his Cheeks in free Currents, had
form’d two sincere little Fountains, on that Part of the Carpet he hung

<p>In the e-text, deleted text is shown with <span class = "delete"
title = "deleted text">solid underlines</span>, while changed text has
<span class = "change sample" title = "edited text">dashed
underlines</span>. Additional features will appear if you hover or click
(changed sections only) on the underlined text. Exact behavior depends
on your browser, so you may need to experiment. In particular, the <span
title = "Title Box"><b>title box</b></span>&mdash;in most current
browsers, smaller text against a yellow background&mdash;may take a few
moments to appear.</p>

<p><b>Deleted text</b> will show a title box giving the <span class =
"delete" title = "{DEL. 7th}">edition number of the deletion</span> in
the form <tt>{DEL. 7th}</tt>.</p>

<p><b>Changed text</b> will have the same type of title box, giving the
edition number of the change in the form <tt>{7th}</tt>. In addition,
the new text will appear, followed by blank space (necessary for
technical reasons) representing the original. The inserted text could
not be formatted, so italics&mdash;or de-italicized word in italic
sections&mdash;are shown with _lowlines_.</p>

<p>Any changes or deletions that span multiple paragraphs are shown
separately for each paragraph.</p>

<p>As noted above, users who find the mouse-hover behavior distracting
need simply keep their mouse or cursor in text-free areas such a margin
or scroll bar.</p>

<p><b>Users who are comfortable editing HTML files</b> should try
replacing the element "border-bottom" in the CSS for
<tt>span.change</tt> and <tt>span.delete</tt> with "outline". Not all
browsers interpret this feature correctly; those that do will outline
the entire text block as a single unit.</p>
